# Logbook for future documentation

## Day 1:

After discussing with few people who have done the project or are currently finishing it, I got few directive lines to learn about DevOps and more specificly about Docker containerization.

First of I learned a bit about Docker daemon: [docker daemon](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/devops/what-is-docker-daemon/), [client-server model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/client-server-model/)

I got told to use few command or Docker options such as `watch` `healthchecks`

Then I started doing [this](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker) course, I'll then check [this](https://github.com/sidpalas/devops-directive-docker-course) course aswell or alternate.
